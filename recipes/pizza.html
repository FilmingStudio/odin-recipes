        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I was looking for a recipe for a taco pizza, but couldn't find exactly the kind I was wanting so I decide to wing it and came up with this one myself. The results were great. My husband said it was the best one he'd ever had! For an extra treat, top with lettuce, tomato and sour cream.</p>
